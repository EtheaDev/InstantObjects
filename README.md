Welcome to InstantObjects, the integrated framework for developing object-oriented business solutions in Delphi (from Delphi 10.1 to latest version)

![Support Delphi](https://github.com/EtheaDev/InstantObjects/wiki/SupportingDelphi.jpg)

InstantObjects is a RAD technology that enables creation of applications based on persistent business objects. It simplifies the process of realizing ideas into products; shortens time-to-market, and helps keep business focus.

Even though it is still a bolted-on technology, InstantObjects integrates with the Delphi IDE and Object Pascal in a simple, flexible and intuitive manner. There are no sophisticated environments that have to be comprehended before application development can begin.

**InstantObjects offers:**

* Model realization in the Delphi IDE via integrated two-way tools (from editor to code)

* Object persistence in the most common relational databases or flat XML-based files (also with FireDAC Broker)

* Object presentation via standard data-aware controls.

* Serialization/Deserialization of object using [delphi-neon](https://github.com/paolo-rossi/delphi-neon) library

**Documentation**

Follow the complete manual present in this [wiki section](https://github.com/EtheaDev/InstantObjects/wiki) and look at the PrimerCross demo to find out how to build applications with an Object Persistence Layer very flexible.

![Primer demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/EtheaDev/InstantObjects/PrimerDemo.gif)

**Project Status**

The project is still managed by [Ethea S.r.l.](https://www.ethea.it), an italian company that uses InstantObjects for [InstantSolution Framework](https://ethea.it/prodotti/instantsolutions/).

You can find more information about this Open-Source project in the wiki section.

**Full DUnitX Tests**

InstantObjects contains over 400 Unit Tests written for DUnitX and ubMock framework.

From 3.0 version is also compatible with TestInsight test framework.

- Support for ModelMaker 6.20 to 9; better ModelMaker support
  in general in ObjectFoundry.

- Support for InstantDate and InstantTime for date-only and
  time-only attribute types.
  
- Instant Model Explorer enhancements:
  - Class B has a base class A and subclasses C, D, etc.
    making a three tier class hierarchy. If Class B is deleted
    classes C, D, etc. will become subclasses of class A.
    Previously they would become subclasses of TInstantObject.

    When adding new class B, unit Y will be automatically
    added to the Interface uses clause of unit X.  
  - Whenever a unit is added to the uses clause of an interface
    section, that unit is removed from the implementation
    section uses clause if present. Whenever a unit is added to the
    implementation section uses clause, check the interface section
    uses clause and if the unit is there then don't add anything.

- Instant model Explorer now uses the newer ToolsAPI on Delphi 7+.

  reference added to InstantObjects. This ensures that the
  InstantObjects in the list are not destroyed prematurely

  was made consistent with TInstantSQLResolver. Adding or
  inserting objects to an InstantSelector now behaves
  consistently for Navigational and SQL based brokers.

  schema, sometimes when store first level part the second 
  level parts are lost in DataBase.

  (like an XML catalog).
